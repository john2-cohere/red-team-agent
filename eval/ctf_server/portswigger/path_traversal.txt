Lab 1: File path traversal, simple case
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
   ../../../etc/passwd
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.


Lab 2: File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value /etc/passwd.
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.


Lab 3: File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
   ....//....//....//etc/passwd
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.


Lab 4: File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
   ..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.


Lab 5: File path traversal, validation of start of path
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
   /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.


Lab 6: File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
   ../../../etc/passwd%00.png
3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
