As a result, the value has looped back around to the minimum possible value (-2,147,483,648).  Clear your cart. In the next few steps, we'll try to add enough units so that the price loops back around and settles between $0 and the $100 of your remaining store credit. This is not mathematically possible using only the leather jacket. Note that the price of the jacket is stored in cents (133700).

In Repeater, observe that you can use the email parameter of the POST request to encrypt arbitrary data and reflect the corresponding ciphertext in the Set-Cookie header. Likewise, you can use the notification cookie in the GET request to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext and reflect the output in the error message. For simplicity, double-click the tab for each request and rename the tabs encrypt and decrypt respectively. In the decrypt request, copy your stay-logged-in cookie and paste it into the notification cookie. Send the request. Instead of the error message, the response now contains the decrypted stay-logged-in cookie, for example: wiener:1598530205184. This reveals that the cookie should be in the format username:timestamp. Copy the timestamp to your clipboard. Go to the encrypt request and change the email parameter to administrator:your-timestamp. Send the request and then copy the new notification cookie from the response. Decrypt this new cookie and observe that the 23-character \" Invalid email address: \" prefix is automatically added to any value you pass in using the email parameter. Send the notification cookie to Burp Decoder. In Decoder, URL-decode and Base64-decode the cookie. In Burp Repeater, switch to the message editor's \"Hex\" tab. Select the first 23 bytes, then right-click and select \"Delete selected bytes\". Re-encode the data and copy the result into the notification cookie of the decrypt request. When you send the request, observe that an error message indicates that a block-based encryption algorithm is used and that the input length must be a multiple of 16. You need to pad the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix with enough bytes so that the number of bytes you will remove is a multiple of 16. In Burp Repeater, go back to the encrypt request and add 9 characters to the start of the intended cookie value, for example: xxxxxxxxxadministrator:your-timestamp. Encrypt this input and use the decrypt request to test that it can be successfully decrypted. Send the new ciphertext to Decoder, then URL and Base64-decode it. This time, delete 32 bytes from the start of the data. Re-encode the data and paste it into the notification parameter in the decrypt request. Check the response to confirm that your input was successfully decrypted and, crucially, no longer contains the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix. You should only see administrator:your-timestamp. From the proxy history, send the GET / request to Burp Repeater. Delete the session cookie entirely, and replace the stay-logged-in cookie with the ciphertext of your self-made cookie.
